MoodLyf
A simple all-in-one wellness platform to track mood, relax, connect, and feel better—anytime, anywhere.


Overview:
Many people, especially students, feel stressed or lonely and don’t have a single place to track their mood, relax, and get support. Wellness Buddy brings all these features into one easy-to-use platform, making self-care simple, fun, and accessible for everyone.

Features:
Mood Tracking & History: Save and view your mood over time with easy charts.
Mood Uplifter & Reminders: Get daily reminders and see if your mood is improving.
Relaxing Activities: Try meditation, breathing exercises, ASMR, music, videos, and sports highlights.
Journaling: Write your thoughts and feelings like a diary.
Chat with Others: Talk to people anonymously for support and friendship.
Multi-language Support: Use the app in different Indian languages.
Cool Background Slideshow: Enjoy beautiful images while using the app.

Problem Statement:
Most wellness apps only focus on one thing, like mood tracking or meditation. Users have to use many apps to get complete support. There is no single platform where you can track your mood, relax, write journals, and connect with others, all in your own language.

How Our Solution Helps
Wellness Buddy brings all important wellness features together in one place. You can track your mood, get daily motivation, relax with activities, write journals, and chat with others—all in one app and in your own language. This makes self-care easy, engaging, and available to everyone.
